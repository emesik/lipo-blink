lipo-blink

A simple LiPo battery checker, which blinks LEDs when any connected cell's
voltage drops to the specified threshold.

It has been designed for a multicopter setup, where illumination LEDs stay
turned on during normal operation and begin to blink once the batteries are
running low.

The code runs on AVR microcontrollers. Current version is designed for ATTiny85
with a single 2S battery pack. However, it might be easily changed to monitor
up to 10 cells on ATTiny26 (or even 11 if you sacrifice the reset pin).

The voltage measurement is being done with voltage dividers. Example
calculations and circuit schemas are included in the doc/ directory.

Attention!

To get accurate results you should use high-precision resistors. A set of
voltage dividers built of standard 5% tolerance resistors may give very broad
range of values for the same voltages.  If you are using such resistors, make
sure that your threshold is defined high enough to avoid a deep-discharge of
the cells.
